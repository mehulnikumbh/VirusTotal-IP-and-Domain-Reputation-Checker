- Outputs results to timestamped files in the `output` directory. (the output directory will be created on your first run)

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or later.
- An API key from [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Dan-Duran/virustotal-ip-rep.git
    cd virustotal-ip-rep
    ```

2. Save your API key in the `settings.py` file:

    Open `settings.py` and replace the placeholder `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key.

    ```python
    API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
    ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your input file with IP addresses and/or domains:

    Create a file (e.g., `input.txt`) and add IP addresses and/or domains to it, one per line.

    Example `input.txt`:

    ```plaintext
    # Add your IP and/or domain list here (one IP/domain per line)
    8.8.8.8
    example.com
    1.1.1.1
    anotherexample.com
    ```

2.1 Run the script (Linux & Mac):

    ```bash
    python3 vt.py
    ```
2.2 Run the script (Windows):

    ```bash
    python vt.py
    ```

3. Follow the on-screen menu to choose the type of check you want to perform:

    - Single IP Address: All info of a single IP
    - Single Domain: All info of a single domain
    - IP/Domain List: Reputation score, country, and stats for each IP/Domain in the list
    - Exit
